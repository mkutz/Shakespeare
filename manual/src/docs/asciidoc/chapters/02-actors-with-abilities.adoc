= Actors with Abilities

== Actors

The central object in a Screenplay and Shakespeare is the link:{javadoc-url}/core/org/shakespeareframework/Actor.html[Actor].
Actors represent something or someone that interacts with the system under test.

There can be any number of Actors in a Screenplay (Test).
To make different Actors easily identifiable, they have a name.
The name can be explicitly given or will be randomly assigned.

== Abilities

Actors may use link:{javadoc-url}/core/org/shakespeareframework/Ability.html[Abilities] to interact with the system under test.

Ability is a simple marker interface.
Implementations should provide methods providing an object which allows interaction with the system under test.
If that object is being generated on demand or simply wrapped by the Ability is up to the implementation.
